Here is a demonstration of using alpha transparency of the Earth model to begin to reveal the human skull below the 
planet's surface.  Particle effects will be used to strip the cloud layer representing the atmosphere, followed by 
erosion of land surfaces, and then evaporation of the oceans to fully reveal the skull.
