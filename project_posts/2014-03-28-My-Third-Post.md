The concept of World Wide Waste is to demonstrate the fragility of the Earth's environment and ecosystems with 
over seven billion humans trampling, deforesting, terraforming its land surface, and using its oceans as a 
large, but still limited-in-size, garbage pit.  Visitors will be able to view the Earth rotating in space with its 
wispy cloud layer intact, and buttons and/or hand gestures will be able to be used to rotate the Earth to any amount 
of axis tilt or longitudinal orientation.  The Earth will continue to rotate after reorientation, and after a period 
of inactivity, will slowly return to a normal axis tilt.

Visitors will also be invited to blow on the planet, which will be detected by a microphone along the edge of the 
display.  3-D particle effects will cause the cloud layer to be disturbed, and continued blowing will cause the land 
surfaces to be eroded and the oceans to be displaced, revealing an image of a human skull below the Earth's surface.  
This will reveal to visitors the lethal effects of what seems to be an insignificant individual human action, 
mirroring what seem to be inconsequential individual actions in our daily lives.  The purpose of the installation is 
to show the beauty of the natural state of our world, and the ugly and even deadly results of careless abuse of the 
environment through seemingly innocuous activities in our ever-increasng industrial "civilization".

The installation itself will be designed to present a minimal impact on the environment as the computing engine drving 
it will be a $35 Raspberry Pi credit card size single-board computer, running free Linux-based software.  The Pi only 
consumes a maximum of three watts of power even when its graphics processing unit (GPU) is running at its 16 32-bit 
integer, and 16 80-bit IEEE standard floating-point, parallel pipelines at 100% capacity.  It generates 1080p HDMI at 
60 Hz, providing an exquisite level of detail and faithful rendering of the beauty of the Earth, while also enabling 
Open GL ES 2.0 3-D graphics effects to be performed in real time in response to visitor actions.  This includes the 
rotation of the Earth and the movement of the atmosphere as evidenced by the cloud layer's dynamics relative to the 
continents and oceans, as well as the particle effects and revelation of the skull below the Earth's surface.
